    "We have seen how one can *declare* classes with the leading \"class\" keyword to support object-oriented programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have also seen that \"everything in python is an object\", and we can visualize all objects in Python with three mini-worlds: the Meta Class world, where \"type\" lives; the class world, where regular classes live; and the instance world, where instances of a class live. They objects can be created when Python compiler parse the code you write, as long as you follow the Python syntax, just like other programming languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today we are going to introduct some *super power* so to speak, which gives programmer similar power of a compiler, which *dynamically* create language constructs, as if you wrote them. This capability is called \"meta-programming\", and modern programming language has such capabilities with various degrees. \n",
    "\n",
    "One example of meta programming that you all have *USED* without realizing is the C Macros. With macros, you can actually define complex functions, and when applied, these functions will be expanded, sometimes recursively, into program text. This expansion is done by a tool called the C Preprocessor, but to the C compiler, the expanded text is as if you wrote it yourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The macro approach however, is a \"poorman\"'s approach, as it is error prone and has to go through another tool. The native meta-programming capability that comes with the language itself is better. We will explore what is available in Python and hopefully increase your awareness in this aspect of langauge expressive power. \n"
