    "Lambda calculus consists of constructing lambda terms and performing reduction operations on them. In the simplest form of lambda calculus, terms are built using only the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $x$: A variable is a character or string representing a parameter.\n",
    "2. $\\lambda x.M $: A lambda abstraction is a function definition, taking as input the bound variable $x$\n",
    " and returning the body $M$\n",
    "3. $(M\\ N)$: An application, applying a function $M$ to an argument $N$, Both $M$ and $N$ are lambda terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reduction operation is simply: $(\\lambda x . M N) → M [x := N]$ replacing the bound variables with the argument expression in the body of the abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazingly, a language as simply as above is proven equivalent to a Turinging machine!\n"

    "The most distincitive feature of functional programming is that it contains no state and side effects (state updating actions). As a result, a function program is just a giant expression. The \"assignment\" you see in a function program is just a *binding* of an expression value to a name for readibility rather than a variable (state) update. We learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. how any imperative program can be transformed into a functional program;\n",
    "2. why functions are first-class citenzen and how to use an lambda expression;≠\n",
    "3. how high-order functions are defined and used;\n",
    "4. how closure (functions with their environment) are defined and used;\n",
    "5. how currying can eliminate functions with multiple arguments.\n",
